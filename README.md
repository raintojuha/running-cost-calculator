Running cost calculator

An application for tracking vehicle running costs

I'm often asked in jooob interviews "why do you do this", meaning software development. My answer is always that I have almost limitless possibilities to create what I want / what I need.
This project is one of those demos that you can build an application from nothing to suit a particular need. Although I don't and have never owned a car.
At the end of the day this prooject is for me to learn more Java, GUI development on Java and file handling.

While starting this project I have been unemployed for a while and thought I could use the practice. I'm also waiting answer from an employer about a Java developer role.

P.S. My keyboard is busted ATM and the letter O key can throw double characters. So if you see typoos you know why.


## Learning diary
This project is first and foremost a learning excercise to complete a project I came up with from start to finish.
I'll document the most relevant things I'll learn during this time.

### JFileChooser
I'm using JFileChooser to open .json files. The chooser looks a bit old and doesn't look like the native File Explorer of the system (Finder on Mac). There is another way to choose files (FileDialog) but using this fell through since I couldn't set a filter for the allowed file extensions. I would like to use this in the future but currently I can go eather way since I'm only using the FileChooser to fetch the file path.
